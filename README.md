Face recognition is a computer vision technology that can be applied for different purposes in various practical applications. In this project, I have explored the application of face recognition in the automated attendance system, which can be used for both educational and organizational purposes. Face detection is the first task to recognize faces from any image or real-time video input. Different state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network-based face detection and face recognition models are available in the computer vision field. We have studied different popular face detection models like HaarCascade, SSD, MTCNN, and YOLOv5. For the face recognition task, we have analyzed LBPH, FaceNet, ArcFace, and DeepFace models. Based on the study using our collected real-life face dataset from mass gathering, we have used the YOLOv5 model for face detection and the ArcFace model for face recognition in this project.
